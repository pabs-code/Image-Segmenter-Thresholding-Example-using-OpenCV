# ImageSegmenter - Thresholding Example

**Description:**

ImageSegmenter is a Python application designed to demonstrate image thresholding techniques for foreground/background segmentation. It provides a simple way to convert an image to grayscale and apply a threshold to isolate specific regions based on pixel intensity values. This example serves as a foundational demonstration of OpenCV's capabilities and can be easily extended for more complex image processing tasks.

**Key Features:**

*   **Grayscale Conversion:** Converts input images from color (BGR) to grayscale, which is essential for thresholding.
*   **Thresholding:** Applies a binary threshold to the grayscale image, separating foreground pixels (above the threshold) from background pixels (below or equal to the threshold).
*   **User-Defined Threshold:** Allows users to adjust the threshold value dynamically, enabling experimentation and fine-tuning of segmentation results.
*   **Clear Visualization:** Displays both the original and thresholded images for easy visual comparison.
*   **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling to gracefully manage scenarios where an image cannot be read.

**Dependencies:**

*   OpenCV (cv2):  `pip install opencv-python`
*   NumPy: `pip install numpy`
*   Streamlit: `pip install streamlit`

**Usage:**

1.  Run the script from your terminal using `python thresholding_example.py`.
2.  The application will display the original and thresholded images, allowing you to adjust the threshold value and observe the effect on segmentation.

**Future Enhancements:**

*   More sophisticated thresholding methods (e.g., adaptive thresholding).
*   Interactive controls for adjusting parameters in a Streamlit app.
*   Integration with other image processing libraries.
*   Saving the segmented image to a file.
